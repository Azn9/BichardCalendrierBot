# Bichard Calendar Bot
This project is a small Discord bot written in Java using Spring Boot, Spring Data, and [Discord4J](https://github.com/Discord4J). It was created for an event taking place on the Discord server of a Twitch streamer named "Bichard" to organise small challenges for its community.
Each day, the players can open a case, from December 1st to December 24th, and then have 24 hours to complete the challenge to win a point. At the end of the calendar, the players with the most points will be awarded a small gift.

The code may not be the best I've done, but I only had a few hours to do it so I did my best. I later fixed the small bugs left when they arose.
